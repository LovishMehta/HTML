   dikhane hai jaise ki image dikhani hai , paragraph dikhana hai mujhe jo bhi element page p dikhana hai us element ko detect karne k liye markup
   tags hote hai

<h1 align="Center"> Registration Form</h1>
-> An HTML element is an individual component of a HTML document (e.g. h1 is an HTML element)
-> It start with a start tag / opening (<h1 align="Center >) tag and ends with an end tag / closing tag (</h1>)
-> The element content is everything between the start and end tag (i.e. in above example Registration Form is the content)
-> Most HTML element can have attributes (e.g. "h1" element has attribute "align") 

All HTML documents must start with a type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>
-> <html>

<html> : It is the root element of an HTML document; all other elements are contained in this.
         The html element delimits the beginning and the end of an HTML document
         
<head> : contains the processing information and metadata for an HTML document. (khi baar hmare HTML page se aur bhi associated files hoti hai jaise ki
         css aur java script files to unko attach karne k liye jo lines likhunga vo header file mai likhunga iske ilave jo mai page k baare mai description
