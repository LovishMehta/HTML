Sementic vs Non Semantic elements :
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Inline vs Block
Block:
A block-level element always starts on a new line.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

Inline:
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Entities in HTML Tag
Some characters are reserved in HTML.
If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

For exampel you want top display less than symbol in "<" heading <h1>, then you cannot directly mention the symbol <h1> < </h1>. So to display these reserved characters
or symbols html has entities. So you will right &lt; to display "<" symbol. <h1> &lt; </h1>.
