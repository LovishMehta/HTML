Sementic vs Non Semantic elements :
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Inline vs Block
Block:
A block-level element always starts on a new line.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

Inline:
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
